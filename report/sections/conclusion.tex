\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This project produced a working real-time polling app and a benchmark comparison 
of Kafka and RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ’s queue/exchange model is easier to understand for 
small or straightforward setups. Kafka is better suited for big, demanding workloads 
because it spreads work across partitions and consumers.

In our workloads Kafka sustained higher throughput and more stable latency as 
load and fan‑out increased, while RabbitMQ showed spikes and variance. For 
high‑volume real‑time feeds like FeedApp, Kafka is the better fit.

We gained practical experience with event-driven design, caching and containerization. 
RabbitMQ remains accessible, but for low‑latency, high‑throughput streams Kafka 
offered clear advantages. The next step is to prepare the system for real production, and possibly add new extensions.
