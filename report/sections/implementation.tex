% This section should provide brief details of how the prototype has been implemented.
% You may want to use come code snippets here, but only focus on core features and aspects.
% You are not meant to copy/paste your whole application code into the report.
% Focus for instance how other developers may run your application and how they might develop it further...


% The example below shows how you may include code. There are similar
% styles for many other langages - in case you do not use Java in your
% project. You can wrap the listing into a figure in case you need to
% refer to it. How to create a figure was shown in Section~\ref{sec:technology}.

\section{Prototype Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

This section summarizes how the FeedApp prototype has been implemented, focusing on the core technical components, the main implementation challenges, and how developers can run or extend the system.

\subsection{Backend Implementation}

Briefly describe:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Spring Boot / Java version,
	\item REST API structure,
	\item PollService architecture (Hibernate, Caching, etc.),
    \item Persistence and messaging (H2, Redis, Kafka),
	\item Security (JWT, authentication flow),
	\item Example of key logic (e.g., cache invalidation or voting process)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frontend Implementation}

Briefly describe:

\begin{itemize}
	\item React + TypeScript structure,
	\item Main components (CreatePoll, VoteOnPoll, CommentSection, Auth),
	\item Communication with backend (REST + WebSocket),
    \item State management and authentication handling,
	\item Short code snippet illustrating an API call or WebSocket usage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Containerization and Deployment}

Describe:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Docker Compose setup (frontend, backend, Redis, Kafka),
	\item Environment variables and ports,
	\item Public images on Docker Hub,
    \item Commands for building and running locally
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extensibility and Future Work}
