\section{Design}
\label{sec:design}

Around 5 pages about functional aspects of the FeedApp application.

\subsection{Use Cases}

Describe:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Main functionality from the user’s perspective,
	\item Actors: Guest User, Registered User, System,
	\item Core use cases: Register/Login, Create Poll, Vote, Comment and Managing Polls,
    \item Brief explanation of real-time updates and visibility (public/private polls)
\end{itemize}

Optional:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use Case Diagram (Figure: Use case overview)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Domain Model}


Describe:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Core domain entities (User, Poll, Vote, VoteOption, Comment(?)),
	\item Relationships between them (one-to-many, many-to-one),
	\item Persistence through JPA/Hibernate
\end{itemize}

Optional:

\begin{itemize}
	\item UML Class Diagram (Figure: Domain Model Overview)
	
	Show main entities, attributes, and associations
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Architecture (including applied technologies)}

Describe:

\begin{itemize}
	\item High-level architecture (frontend–backend–infrastructure),
	\item Backend layers: Controller, Service, Repository,
	\item Key technologies: Spring Boot, H2, Redis, Kafka, WebSocket, JWT,
	\item Frontend technologies: React, TypeScript, REST API communication,
	\item Interaction between components (data flow from frontend to backend),
\end{itemize}

Optional:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Architecture Diagram (Figure: System Architecture)
	
	Show containers/components (Frontend, Backend, Redis, Kafka, DB, WebSocket)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}

Summarize:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How the design supports scalability, modularity, and real-time updates,
	\item The rationale behind chosen technologies,
	\item How the design connects to later implementation and deployment steps
\end{itemize}
